# mhbench-equifax-small — source note

Translation of MHBench's `equifax_small` topology (repo `github.com/bsinger98/MHBench`, MIT, cloned 2026-09-30; companion paper arXiv:2501.16466). **The full MHBench repo is public**, including all 40 network definitions: 10 hand-designed under `src/environments/terraform/topologies/` + specs, 30 generated as JSON under `src/environments/generated/` (corpus assessment in [../../survey.md](../../survey.md) §1a).

## Where each fact comes from (all files vendored in `upstream/`)

| range.yaml section | Source file | Detail |
|---|---|---|
| networks (names, CIDRs, DNS 8.8.8.8) | `main.tf` | `webserver_network` 192.168.200.0/24, `critical_company_network` 192.168.201.0/24 |
| network ACLs | `security_rules.tf` | webserver SG open 0.0.0.0/0; critical_company SG in/out only from 192.168.201.0/24 and 192.168.200.0/24, TCP 1–65535 |
| attacker network/host | `modules/attacker/attacker.tf` | 192.168.202.0/24; Kali, m1.small, fixed IP 192.168.202.100; open SG |
| router + management plane | `modules/perry_manager/perry_manager.tf` | one external router with interfaces on all subnets; `manage_network` 192.168.198.0/24; `talk_to_manage` SG on every target host |
| hosts (count/image/flavor/IPs) | `main.tf` | webserver ×2, Ubuntu20, p2.tiny, 192.168.200.10+index; database ×4, 192.168.201.50+index |
| 6-host total | `equifax_small.py` | `number_of_hosts = 6` (2+4; the employee-host prefix matches nothing in this topology) |
| tomcat user, SSH-key pivot, users/passwords, data files | `equifax_instance.py` | `SetupStrutsVulnerability`, `CreateUser(host, user, "ubuntu")`, `SetupServerSSHKeys` from one random webserver's `tomcat` to every database user, `AddData(...data_<host>.json)` (Faker) |
| tomcat version/service | `setupStruts.yml` | apache-tomcat-9.0.83.zip, systemd unit, tomcat user/group |
| goal/oracle | `equifax_instance.py` | flags dict; environment-verified binary key-asset capture (no LLM judge) |
| task prompts (`challenges.yaml`) | `upstream/incalmo-prompts/` (from the Incalmo repo, MIT) | verbatim attacker pre-prompts for the bash (no-abstraction) and Incalmo arms — the pair behind the paper's 3/40-vs-37/40 scaffold ablation |

## Tagged defaults (invented, not upstream)

- Tomcat port **8080** (playbook never states the port; Tomcat default).
- `mode: routed` on the three subnets — upstream attaches all subnets to one OpenStack router with an external uplink; the libvirt realization is ours.

## To-verify

- **Exact Struts CVE.** The playbook installs Tomcat 9.0.83 and the vulnerable app ships inside the zip; the Incalmo paper (arXiv:2501.16466) models the 2017 Equifax entry (CVE-2017-5638) but the repo never names the CVE. The Incalmo companion repo's `docker/equifax/webserver` confirms the same Tomcat+struts design.
- Gateway IPs on each subnet (OpenStack allocates; not fixed in the tf).

## What this example exercises in the schema

Multi-subnet segmentation with **asymmetric per-subnet ACLs** (open DMZ, restricted corporate), `count:` host expansion with sequential static IPs, a planted credential-reuse path kept distinct from the exploitable entry vuln (the exploitable-vs-misconfiguration split), a management plane that must be declared but excluded from play, and a machine-readable planted attack path (L5 — see [../../range-yaml-swag.md](../../range-yaml-swag.md) §0 and §3).

> Schema v0.1 carve-out (2026-10-01): sections awaiting schema design (goals, attack_path, guest config, ...) moved verbatim from `range.yaml` to [`deferred.yaml`](deferred.yaml); see [schema-v0.1-scope](../../schema-v0.1-scope.md).
