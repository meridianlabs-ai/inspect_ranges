# Networks – Inspect Ranges

## Overview

This page covers the networking half of the definition language, starting with a single network and adding one construct at a time. For the anatomy of a full range definition, see the [Ranges](./ranges.html.md) overview; guest-side fields (images, resources, operating systems) are covered in [Guests](./guests.html.md).

## Flat Network

The smallest range: one network, one target, and the attacker:

``` yaml
range:
  name: flat
  description: One target on one flat network.

networks:
  - name: lab
    cidr: 10.10.10.0/24
    mode: isolated

hosts:
  - name: web
    os: { type: linux }
    image: acme/web-golden
    interfaces: [{ network: lab }]

attacker:
  interfaces: [{ network: lab }]
  entry: external
```

``` python
from inspect_ranges.types import (
    Attacker, Host, Interface, Network, Os, RangeMeta, RangeSpec,
)

flat = RangeSpec(
    meta=RangeMeta(
        name="flat", description="One target on one flat network."
    ),
    networks=[
        Network(name="lab", cidr="10.10.10.0/24", mode="isolated")
    ],
    hosts=[
        Host(
            name="web",
            os=Os(type="linux"),
            image="acme/web-golden",
            interfaces=[Interface(network="lab")],
        )
    ],
    attacker=Attacker(
        interfaces=[Interface(network="lab")], entry="external"
    ),
)
```

Every guest attaches to networks explicitly through `interfaces`. The attacker is an ordinary guest (a dedicated VM with a real NIC in the broadcast domain), declared separately because evaluations map it to `sandbox("default")`. All models live in `inspect_ranges.types`; the import is shown once above, and later Python tabs omit it.

`mode: isolated` means no traffic leaves the range from this network. Use it unless the range needs egress; `nat` and `routed` are covered [below](#egress).

## Addressing

Addresses are optional. When omitted, they are allocated deterministically: the same definition always produces the same addresses (routers take the first usable addresses, the attacker follows, hosts allocate from `.10` upward). Explicit addresses are validated against the subnet and for conflicts:

``` yaml
range:
  name: addressing
  description: Explicit and allocated addresses on one segment.

networks:
  - name: lab
    cidr: 10.10.10.0/24
    mode: isolated

hosts:
  - name: web
    os: { type: linux }
    image: acme/web-golden
    interfaces: [{ network: lab, ip: 10.10.10.80 }]  # explicit
  - name: db
    os: { type: linux }
    image: acme/db-golden
    interfaces: [{ network: lab }]  # allocated: 10.10.10.10

attacker:
  interfaces: [{ network: lab }]  # allocated: 10.10.10.2
  entry: external
```

``` python
addressing = RangeSpec(
    meta=RangeMeta(
        name="addressing",
        description="Explicit and allocated addresses on one segment.",
    ),
    networks=[
        Network(name="lab", cidr="10.10.10.0/24", mode="isolated")
    ],
    hosts=[
        Host(
            name="web",
            os=Os(type="linux"),
            image="acme/web-golden",
            interfaces=[Interface(network="lab", ip="10.10.10.80")],
        ),
        Host(
            name="db",
            os=Os(type="linux"),
            image="acme/db-golden",
            interfaces=[Interface(network="lab")],
        ),
    ],
    attacker=Attacker(
        interfaces=[Interface(network="lab")], entry="external"
    ),
)
```

Networks can also address their guests over DHCP. DHCP is reservation-only: every lease comes from the deterministic allocation by MAC address, so DHCP addressing is as predictable as static addressing while a real DHCP service runs on the segment:

``` yaml
range:
  name: dhcp
  description: Guests addressed over reservation-only DHCP.

networks:
  - name: lab
    cidr: 10.10.10.0/24
    mode: isolated
    dhcp: true

hosts:
  - name: web
    os: { type: linux }
    image: acme/web-golden
1    interfaces: [{ network: lab, ip: 10.10.10.80 }]

attacker:
  interfaces: [{ network: lab }]
  entry: external
```

1  
The lease is reserved for web’s MAC address.

``` python
dhcp = RangeSpec(
    meta=RangeMeta(
        name="dhcp",
        description="Guests addressed over reservation-only DHCP.",
    ),
    networks=[
        Network(
            name="lab", cidr="10.10.10.0/24", mode="isolated", dhcp=True
        )
    ],
    hosts=[
        Host(
            name="web",
            os=Os(type="linux"),
            image="acme/web-golden",
            interfaces=[Interface(network="lab", ip="10.10.10.80")],
        )
    ],
    attacker=Attacker(
        interfaces=[Interface(network="lab")], entry="external"
    ),
)
```

## Name Resolution

A network can declare DNS in three ways. `records` serves names from the range itself (for name-based discovery on flat networks); a record without an `ip` resolves to the named guest’s address:

``` yaml
range:
  name: dns-records
  description: Range-served name records, derived and explicit.

networks:
  - name: lab
    cidr: 10.10.10.0/24
    mode: isolated
    dns:
      records:
        - { name: web }  # resolves to web's address
        - { name: files.corp.example, ip: 10.10.10.200 }

hosts:
  - name: web
    os: { type: linux }
    image: acme/web-golden
    interfaces: [{ network: lab }]

attacker:
  interfaces: [{ network: lab }]
  entry: external
```

``` python
dns_records = RangeSpec(
    meta=RangeMeta(
        name="dns-records",
        description="Range-served name records, derived and explicit.",
    ),
    networks=[
        Network(
            name="lab",
            cidr="10.10.10.0/24",
            mode="isolated",
            dns=DnsConfig(
                records=[
                    DnsRecord(name="web"),  # resolves to web's address
                    DnsRecord(
                        name="files.corp.example", ip="10.10.10.200"
                    ),
                ]
            ),
        )
    ],
    hosts=[
        Host(
            name="web",
            os=Os(type="linux"),
            image="acme/web-golden",
            interfaces=[Interface(network="lab")],
        )
    ],
    attacker=Attacker(
        interfaces=[Interface(network="lab")], entry="external"
    ),
)
```

Networks with `records` hand their guests a derived search domain (`<network>.internal`), because modern stub resolvers do not send single-label names like `web` to DNS without one.

`nameservers` points guests at external resolvers, and `authoritative` names guests (such as domain controllers) that are the network’s DNS servers, optionally chaining to a `forwarder`. This is the Active Directory pattern: the DC is the DNS server:

``` yaml
range:
  name: dns-ad
  description: An authoritative guest serves DNS, chaining to an upstream forwarder.

networks:
  - name: corp
    cidr: 10.20.0.0/24
    mode: isolated
    dns:
      authoritative: [dc01]
      forwarder: 1.1.1.1

hosts:
  - name: dc01
    hostname: dc01
    fqdn: dc01.corp.example
    os: { type: linux }
    image: acme/dc-golden
    interfaces: [{ network: corp, ip: 10.20.0.5 }]
  - name: ws01
    os: { type: linux }
    image: acme/ws-golden
    interfaces: [{ network: corp }]

attacker:
  interfaces: [{ network: corp }]
  entry: assumed-breach
```

``` python
dns_ad = RangeSpec(
    meta=RangeMeta(
        name="dns-ad",
        description="An authoritative guest serves DNS, chaining to "
        "an upstream forwarder.",
    ),
    networks=[
        Network(
            name="corp",
            cidr="10.20.0.0/24",
            mode="isolated",
            dns=DnsConfig(authoritative=["dc01"], forwarder="1.1.1.1"),
        )
    ],
    hosts=[
        Host(
            name="dc01",
            hostname="dc01",
            fqdn="dc01.corp.example",
            os=Os(type="linux"),
            image="acme/dc-golden",
            interfaces=[Interface(network="corp", ip="10.20.0.5")],
        ),
        Host(
            name="ws01",
            os=Os(type="linux"),
            image="acme/ws-golden",
            interfaces=[Interface(network="corp")],
        ),
    ],
    attacker=Attacker(
        interfaces=[Interface(network="corp")], entry="assumed-breach"
    ),
)
```

## Segmentation

Routers join segments and carry the inter-segment policy. Rules are default-deny and stateful: anything not allowed is dropped, and return traffic of allowed flows always passes. For example, a DMZ pivot:

``` yaml
range:
  name: dmz-pivot
  description: >
    An external attacker compromises a web server in the DMZ, then pivots to a
    database on an internal segment reachable only through the router.

networks:
  - name: dmz
    cidr: 10.80.10.0/24
    mode: isolated
  - name: internal
    cidr: 10.80.20.0/24
    mode: isolated

routers:
  - name: router
    interfaces:
      - { network: dmz, ip: 10.80.10.1 }
      - { network: internal, ip: 10.80.20.1 }
    acl:
      - { from: dmz, to: internal, allow: [tcp/5432] }

hosts:
  - name: web
    os: { type: linux }
    image: acme/web-golden
    interfaces: [{ network: dmz, ip: 10.80.10.10 }]
  - name: db
    os: { type: linux }
    image: acme/db-golden
    interfaces: [{ network: internal }]

attacker:
  interfaces: [{ network: dmz }]
  entry: external
```

``` python
dmz_pivot = RangeSpec(
    meta=RangeMeta(
        name="dmz-pivot",
        description="An external attacker compromises a web server in "
        "the DMZ, then pivots to a database on an internal segment "
        "reachable only through the router.",
    ),
    networks=[
        Network(name="dmz", cidr="10.80.10.0/24", mode="isolated"),
        Network(name="internal", cidr="10.80.20.0/24", mode="isolated"),
    ],
    routers=[
        Router(
            name="router",
            interfaces=[
                Interface(network="dmz", ip="10.80.10.1"),
                Interface(network="internal", ip="10.80.20.1"),
            ],
            acl=[
                AclRule(from_="dmz", to="internal", allow=["tcp/5432"])
            ],
        )
    ],
    hosts=[
        Host(
            name="web",
            os=Os(type="linux"),
            image="acme/web-golden",
            interfaces=[Interface(network="dmz", ip="10.80.10.10")],
        ),
        Host(
            name="db",
            os=Os(type="linux"),
            image="acme/db-golden",
            interfaces=[Interface(network="internal")],
        ),
    ],
    attacker=Attacker(
        interfaces=[Interface(network="dmz")], entry="external"
    ),
)
```

Each segment is its own broadcast domain: L2 tradecraft like ARP and LLMNR poisoning works within a segment and stops at the router. The router is an ordinary guest running a generated nftables firewall that a defender inside the range can inspect.

## Rules

Rules evaluate first-match in declaration order, and each rule carries exactly one of `allow:` or `deny:`. Endpoints are a network name, a guest name (resolved to its allocated addresses at compile time), or a CIDR (`/32` for a single host, `0.0.0.0/0` for any). Services are `proto/port`, `proto/lo-hi` ranges, or bare `icmp`:

``` yaml
range:
  name: policy
  description: Ordered rules with carve-outs, guest endpoints, and CIDR endpoints.

networks:
  - name: dmz
    cidr: 10.80.10.0/24
    mode: isolated
  - name: internal
    cidr: 10.80.20.0/24
    mode: isolated

routers:
  - name: router
    interfaces: [{ network: dmz }, { network: internal }]
    acl:
1      - { from: dmz, to: db, deny: [tcp/22] }
      - { from: dmz, to: internal, allow: [tcp/22, tcp/5432, icmp] }
2      - { from: web, to: internal, allow: [tcp/80] }
3      - { from: 10.80.10.0/28, to: internal, allow: [tcp/8080-8090] }

hosts:
  - name: web
    os: { type: linux }
    image: acme/web-golden
    interfaces: [{ network: dmz, ip: 10.80.10.10 }]
  - name: db
    os: { type: linux }
    image: acme/db-golden
    interfaces: [{ network: internal }]

attacker:
  interfaces: [{ network: dmz }]
  entry: external
```

1  
A carve-out: ssh to the db host is dropped even though the next rule allows `tcp/22`.

2  
Only the web server may open http into the internal segment.

3  
A literal address range as an endpoint.

``` python
policy = RangeSpec(
    meta=RangeMeta(
        name="policy",
        description="Ordered rules with carve-outs, guest endpoints, "
        "and CIDR endpoints.",
    ),
    networks=[
        Network(name="dmz", cidr="10.80.10.0/24", mode="isolated"),
        Network(name="internal", cidr="10.80.20.0/24", mode="isolated"),
    ],
    routers=[
        Router(
            name="router",
            interfaces=[
                Interface(network="dmz"),
                Interface(network="internal"),
            ],
            acl=[
1                AclRule(from_="dmz", to="db", deny=["tcp/22"]),
                AclRule(
                    from_="dmz",
                    to="internal",
                    allow=["tcp/22", "tcp/5432", "icmp"],
                ),
                AclRule(
                    from_="web", to="internal", allow=["tcp/80"]
2                ),
                AclRule(
                    from_="10.80.10.0/28",
                    to="internal",
                    allow=["tcp/8080-8090"],
3                ),
            ],
        )
    ],
    hosts=[
        Host(
            name="web",
            os=Os(type="linux"),
            image="acme/web-golden",
            interfaces=[Interface(network="dmz", ip="10.80.10.10")],
        ),
        Host(
            name="db",
            os=Os(type="linux"),
            image="acme/db-golden",
            interfaces=[Interface(network="internal")],
        ),
    ],
    attacker=Attacker(
        interfaces=[Interface(network="dmz")], entry="external"
    ),
)
```

1  
A carve-out: ssh to the db host is dropped even though the next rule allows `tcp/22`.

2  
Only the web server may open http into the internal segment.

3  
A literal address range as an endpoint.

Networks and guests share one namespace (a guest may not take a network’s name), so an endpoint is never ambiguous. Unknown endpoints are rejected at validation with a did-you-mean suggestion.

## Topology

Larger networks chain routers. Each network’s default gateway is elected implicitly when exactly one router attaches; a segment with more than one router must declare its `gateway:` (declaring none is an error; the compiler does not guess). Routers carry static `routes:` to segments they reach through other routers, and their rules may name routed segments as well as attached ones (each transit router enforces its own policy):

``` yaml
range:
  name: chained
  description: Three segments chained through two routers.

networks:
  - name: dmz
    cidr: 10.80.10.0/24
    mode: isolated
  - name: core
    cidr: 10.80.20.0/24
    mode: isolated

    acl:
      - { from: dmz, to: vault, allow: [tcp/443] }
  - name: r2
    interfaces:
      - { network: core, ip: 10.80.20.2 }
      - { network: vault, ip: 10.80.30.1 }
    routes: [{ to: 10.80.10.0/24, via: 10.80.20.1 }]

## Leaving the range

Each network declares its egress posture through `mode`:

- `isolated`: nothing leaves. The default posture.
- `nat`: traffic leaves through hypervisor NAT, scoped by an explicit allowlist.
- `routed`: the segment is routed toward the deployment’s uplink, in both directions, with real source addresses and no NAT.

A `nat` network lists what may leave; everything else is dropped. Entries are `CIDR[:proto/port]` (a bare address is its `/32`; omitting the service allows all traffic to the CIDR):

``` yaml
range:
  name: egress
  description: A corp segment that may reach one https host and NTP, nothing else.

networks:
  - name: corp
    cidr: 10.90.10.0/24
    mode: nat
    egress:
      allow:
        - "198.51.100.7:tcp/443"
        - "0.0.0.0/0:udp/123"

hosts:
  - name: workstation
    os: { type: linux }
    image: acme/ws-golden
    interfaces: [{ network: corp }]

attacker:
  interfaces: [{ network: corp }]
  entry: assumed-breach
  egress: none
```

``` python
egress = RangeSpec(
    meta=RangeMeta(
        name="egress",
        description="A corp segment that may reach one https host and "
        "NTP, nothing else.",
    ),
    networks=[
        Network(
            name="corp",
            cidr="10.90.10.0/24",
            mode="nat",
            egress=EgressPolicy(
                allow=["198.51.100.7:tcp/443", "0.0.0.0/0:udp/123"]
            ),
        )
    ],
    hosts=[
        Host(
            name="workstation",
            os=Os(type="linux"),
            image="acme/ws-golden",
            interfaces=[Interface(network="corp")],
        )
    ],
    attacker=Attacker(
        interfaces=[Interface(network="corp")],
        entry="assumed-breach",
        egress="none",
    ),
)
```

The attacker’s own `egress` composes ahead of network policy: `none` (the default) drops the attacker’s flows even on a network with an allowlist, `open` permits them, and the same `{allow: [...]}` form scopes them. Egress is enforced in the hypervisor’s network namespace, outside every VM: an attacker that compromises every guest, including the router, cannot widen it.

Egress-by-name is part of the vocabulary but not yet realized, so it is rejected with a specific code:

``` yaml
range:
  name: egress-fqdn
  description: FQDN entries are in the vocabulary but gated.
networks:
  - name: corp
    cidr: 10.90.10.0/24
    mode: nat
    egress:
      allow: ["updates.example.com:tcp/443"]
hosts:
  - name: ws
    os: { type: linux }
    image: acme/ws-golden
    interfaces: [{ network: corp }]
attacker:
  interfaces: [{ network: corp }]
  entry: assumed-breach
```

## Attacker

The attacker either boots as a dedicated attack box (declare `interfaces`, optionally `name`, `image`, and `resources`) or starts from a foothold on a declared host (assumed breach):

``` yaml
range:
  name: foothold
  description: The attacker starts from a foothold on the web server.

networks:
  - name: dmz
    cidr: 10.80.10.0/24
    mode: isolated

hosts:
  - name: web
    os: { type: linux }
    image: acme/web-golden
    interfaces: [{ network: dmz }]

attacker:
  host: web
  entry: assumed-breach
```

``` python
foothold = RangeSpec(
    meta=RangeMeta(
        name="foothold",
        description="The attacker starts from a foothold on the web "
        "server.",
    ),
    networks=[
        Network(name="dmz", cidr="10.80.10.0/24", mode="isolated")
    ],
    hosts=[
        Host(
            name="web",
            os=Os(type="linux"),
            image="acme/web-golden",
            interfaces=[Interface(network="dmz")],
        )
    ],
    attacker=Attacker(host="web", entry="assumed-breach"),
)
```

`entry` records how the attacker arrives (`external`, `assumed-breach`, or `operator`) for scorers and dataset builders.
